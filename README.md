###### After choosing one of the choices the programe will continue with the user the other choices that will appear.
###### In the prompt there will be what is the type of information that user should write.
###### After storing a new student the first three options will appear again. If the user choose to change the marks,
###### A new list will appear with subjects to choose what subject user want.
